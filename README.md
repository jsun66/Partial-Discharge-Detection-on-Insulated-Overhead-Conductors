# Background and Purpose
Nowadays, aerial covered conductors (CC) are increasingly used in many places of the world due to their higher operational reliability, reduced construction space and effective protection for wildlife animals. In spite of these advantages, a major challenge of using CC is that the ordinary upstream protection devices are not able to detect the phase-to-ground faults and the frequent tree/tree branch hitting conductor events on such conductors. This is because these events only lead to partial discharge (PD) activities rather than overcurrent signatures typically seen on bare conductors. To solve this problem, in recent years, ENET Centre in Czech Republic (ENET) devised a simple meter to measure the voltage signal of the electric stray field along CC, aiming to detect the above hazardous PD activities. In 2018, ENET published a large amount of waveform data recorded by their meter on Kaggle, the world's largest data science collaboration platform, encouraging worldwide experts to develop an effective pattern recognition method for the acquired signals. In response, we developed a unique pattern recognition method based on time-series decomposition and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) in addition to unique feature engineering process to recognize PD activities.
# Modeling Method
The flowchart of the method is shown in Fig.1: first, Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) is employed as a time-series decomposition technique to decompose every raw voltage signal into three components, i.e. trend, seasonal and residual components. The proposed method then focuses on the residual components of each signal where irregular noise such as PD is most abundant. In order to cover a wide range of information and enhance robustness, four different STL modules with four different seasonalwindow lengths are applied to produce four different residual components. At the step of feature engineering, each whole-cycle residual component is divided to different time steps; for each time step, three features are engineered to characterize the signals; a special noise reduction method is used to eliminate noises that are less likely caused by PD; then for every time step, twelve features from four residual components are merged and normalized together to generate a sequential feature vector; oversampling technique is also adopted to balance out the records with PD activities and the records with no PD activities. In the end, many-to-one sequential records are constructed and are fed into a long short-term memory network (LSTM) classifier. Finally, the LSTM classifier is trained and can be used to recognize new PD signals acquired by the meter effectively.

# Feature Construction
To characterize the residual component, three features are proposed: the number of peaks, the sum of absolute peak heights and the standard deviation of absolute peak heights. Absolute values are used because there is no actual pattern difference between the positive and negative values in the residual component.
Fig. 2 shows a 3D-plot of PD signals and non-PD signals characterized by the above three features. As can be seen, there is a hypothetical discrimination hyperplane (diagonal) between most of the green points and red points. This means most of the green points and red points are separable when characterized by the three features. Fundamentally, this is how a classifier can classify data points (similar to a hyperplane determined by a support vector machine). Although there are still data outliers, such separation between two classes makes statistical sense. With the help of LSTM network which can analyze features in all four quarter-cycles, the classification performance can be further enhanced to an acceptable range, as verified in Section 6. Fig. 2 shows a 3D plot of the three features of 1000 randomly selected signals in the first quarter-cycle.

# Results of time-series decomposition
STL with four different lengths of seasonal windows is applied to each waveform signal to produce four different STL decompositions. The lengths of the window are set to be 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000 points. An example of the decomposition result with 1000-point window length is shown in Fig.3.

# Results of 4-time step LSTM classifier
Common classification evaluation tools including confusion matrix, precision, recall and F1-Score are used in the evaluation of the LSTM classifier. The confusion matrix of the 4-time step LSTM classifier is shown in Table 1. TP, FP, TN and FN stand for true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative counts. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total predicted observations. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total actual PD or non-PD observations.
